In courses that use cohorts, you can create discussion topics that are either
divided based on cohort, or unified and available to all learners.

For information about divided discussions, see :ref:`About Divided
Discussions`.

For information about managing and moderating discussions, see :ref:`Managing
Divided Discussion Topics` and :ref:`Guidance for Discussion Moderators`.
